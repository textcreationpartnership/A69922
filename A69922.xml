            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Wee cannot but make one Argument more of the truth of Our Profe≈ø≈øion, that this was all Our end, and that Wee had not the lea≈øt thought, by ≈øo advancing, to ≈øurpri≈øe and lack <hi>London</hi> (which the malignant party would infu≈øe into that Our Citty) And that is: That probably God Almighty would not have given ≈øuch a Ble≈ø≈øing to Our Iourney, as to have a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øted Vs ≈øo both by Land and Water, as with le≈ø≈øe then a third part of Our foot, and with the lo≈ø≈øe but of tenne men, to beat two of their be≈øt Regiments out of both <hi>Braincefords,</hi> for all the great advantage of their workes in them, to kill him who commanded in chiefe, and kill and drowne many others, to take five hundred Pri≈øoners, more Armes, eleven Colours, and good ≈øtore of Ammunition, fifteene Peeces of Ordinance (whereof Wee ≈øunke mo≈øt that Wee brought not away) and then unfought with, and unoffered at, neerer then by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to march away, notwith≈øtanding the great di≈øadvantage
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64629:5"/>of Our Forces by the difficulties of the Pa≈ø≈øages, if Hee who is the ≈øearcher of all hearts and truth it ≈øelfe had not knowne the truth of Our Profe≈ø≈øions, and the Innocence of Our Heart, And how farre Wee were from de≈øerving tho≈øe horrid Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øations of fal≈øehood and Treachery ca≈øt ≈øo point blanke upon Our owne Per≈øon, That it would amaze any man to ≈øee them ≈øuffered to bee printed in Our Citty of <hi>London,</hi> if any thing of that kind could bee a wonder after ≈øo many of the ≈øame, and how really they de≈øire Accommodation, who upon this have Voted they will have none.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe Our Rea≈øons for this Action, this Our ≈øatisfaction ≈øent for it, and this Ble≈ø≈øing of God's upon it, (will We doubt not) cleere Vs to all indifferent per≈øons both of the Ie≈øuiticall Coun≈øels, and per≈øonall Treachery to which ≈øome have pre≈øumed ≈øo impudently to impute it; And God ≈øo ble≈ø≈øe Our future Actions as Wee have delivered the truth of this.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O Your <hi>Maje≈øties</hi> Me≈ø≈øage of the 12. of this Month of <hi>November,</hi> Wee the Lords and Commons in Parliament doe make this humble An≈øwer. That this Me≈ø≈øage was not delivered to us till Monday the 14. Wee thought it a ≈øtrange Introduction to Peace, that Your <hi>Maje≈øty</hi> ≈øhould ≈øend Your Army to beat us out of our Quarters at <hi>Brainceford,</hi> and then appoint that place to receive our Propo≈øitions, which, yet it plainely appeares, Your <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty</hi> intended not to receive till You had fir≈øt tried, whether you could breake through the Army rai≈øed for Defence of this Kingdome and Parliament, and take the Citty being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided and ≈øecure in expectation of a faire Treaty made to ≈øecure the Citty. If herein Your <hi>Maje≈øty</hi> had prevailed, after You had de≈øtroyed the Army and ma≈øtered the Citty, it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie to imagine, what a mi≈øerable Peace Wee ≈øhould have had, and whether tho≈øe Cour≈øes bee ≈øutable to the Expre≈ø≈øions Your <hi>Maje≈øty</hi> is plea≈øed to make in Your An≈øwer to our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Your Earne≈øtne≈øse to avoyd any further Effu≈øion of bloud, let God and the World judge.</p>
                  <p>As for our Proceedings, they havein all things beene an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwerable to our Profe≈ø≈øions: wee gave directions to the Earle of <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> to draw the Army under his Command out of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64629:7"/>Citty and Suburbs, before wee ≈øent any Me≈ø≈øage to Your <hi>Maje≈øty.</hi> So that part of it was inquartered at <hi>Brainceford</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Committee returned with Your An≈øwer. And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the Receipt thereof, that very Morning Order was taken that the Souldiers ≈øhould Exerci≈øe no Act of ho≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity again≈øt any of Your <hi>Maje≈øties</hi> People. Wee ≈øent a letter by Sir <hi>Peter Killigrew</hi> to know Your <hi>Maje≈øties</hi> plea≈øure whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther You intended the like forbearance of ho≈øtility. But the fury of Your Souldiers, thir≈øting after bloud and ≈øpoile, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the delivery of the letter. For comming upon Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in his way towards Your <hi>Maje≈øty</hi> as farre as <hi>Brainceford,</hi> hee found them in ≈øight there and could pa≈ø≈øe no further. God who ≈øees our Innocency, and that wee have no Aymes, but at his Glory and the publique good, will (wee hope) free Your <hi>Maje≈øty</hi> from tho≈øe de≈øtructive Coun≈øels who labour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their owne power by bloud and rapine, and ble≈ø≈øe our Endeavours, who ≈øeeke nothing, but to procure and e≈øtabli≈øh the Honour, Peace and Safety of Your <hi>Maje≈øty</hi> and Kingdomes, upon the ≈øure foundation of Religion and Ju≈øtice.</p>

                  <p>THat His Me≈ø≈øage of the 12. though not received by them till the 14. was ≈øent to them fir≈øt upon the ≈øame day upon which it was dated, and meeting with ≈øtops by the way, was againe ≈øent upon the 13. and taken upon that day at tenne in the morning by the Earle of <hi>E≈ø≈øex,</hi> and though
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64629:8"/>not to him directed, was by him opened, ≈øo the ≈ølowne≈ø≈øe of the Delivery is not ≈øo ≈øtrange as the ≈øtoppe of the Letter ≈øaid to bee ≈øent by Sir <hi>Peter Killigrew,</hi> which his Maje≈øty hath not yet received, but concludes from the matter expre≈ø≈øed to have beene contain'd in that Letter (to wit to know his Plea≈øure, whether Hee intended the forbearance of Ho≈øtility) and by the Command of ≈øuch forbearance ≈øaid to bee ≈øent to the Lord of <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> his Army, that no ≈øuch forbearance was already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and con≈øequently neither had His Maje≈øty cau≈øe to ≈øuppo≈øe, that Hee ≈øhould take any of their forces unprovided and ≈øecure in expectation of a faire Treaty, neither could any Ho≈øtile Act of His Maje≈øties Forces have beene a cour≈øe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øutable to His expre≈ø≈øions, much le≈ø≈øe could an endeavour to prepo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe (for ≈øo Hee hoped Hee might have done) that Place, which might have ≈øtopt the farther March of tho≈øe Forces towards Him, (which, for ought appear'd to him, might as well have beene intended to <hi>Colebrooke</hi> as to <hi>Brainceford</hi> and by that the further effu≈øion of bloud, de≈øerve that ≈øtile.</p>
                  <p>His Maje≈øty farther conceives, that the Printing ≈øo out of time of ≈øuch a Declaration, as their <hi>Reply</hi> to his <hi>An≈øwer</hi> to their of the 26. of <hi>May,</hi> but the day before they Voted the Delivery of their Petition, and the March of the Earle of <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to <hi>Brainceford</hi> ≈øo neere to his Maje≈øty, when the <hi>Committee</hi> at the ≈øame time attended Him with a Petition for a Treaty, the Earle of <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> being before po≈ø≈øe≈øt of all the other Avenues to his Army, by his Forces at <hi>Wind≈øore, Acton,</hi> and <hi>King≈øton,</hi> was a more ≈øtrange introduction to Peace, then for His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty not to ≈øuffer Him≈øelfe to bee coopt up on all ≈øides, becau≈øe a Treaty had beene mention'd, which was ≈øo really and ≈øo much de≈øired by His Maje≈øty, that this Proceeding ≈øeemes to Him purpo≈øely by ≈øome intended to divert (which it could not doe) that His Inclination.</p>
                  <p>That His Maje≈øty had no intention to ma≈øter the Citty by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64629:8"/>≈øo advancing, be≈øides His profe≈ø≈øion, which (how meanely ≈øoever they ≈øeeme to value it) Hee conceived a ≈øufficient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, (e≈øpecially being onely oppos'd by ≈øu≈øpicions and ≈øurmi≈øes) may appeare by His not Pur≈øuing His Victory at <hi>Brainceford,</hi> but giving orders to His Army to March away to <hi>King≈øton</hi> as ≈øoone as Hee heard that place was quitted, before any notice or Appearance of farther Forces from <hi>London;</hi> Nor could Hee find a better way to ≈øatisfie them before hand, that Hee had no ≈øuch intention, but that His de≈øire of Peace, and of Propo≈øitions that might conduce to it, ≈øtill continued, then by that Me≈ø≈øage of the 12. for which care of His Hee was required by ≈øuch a Reception of His Me≈ø≈øage and Me≈ø≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as was contrary at once both to duty, civility, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cu≈øtomes, and Law of Warre, and Nations, and ≈øuch as theirs (though after this Provocation) hath not found from Him.</p>
                  <p>His Maje≈øty wonders that His Souldiers ≈øhould be charged with thir≈øting after bloud, who tooke above five hundred Pri≈øoners in the very heat of the fight, His Maje≈øty having ≈øince di≈ømi≈ø≈øed all the Common Souldiers, and entertain'd ≈øuch as were willing to ≈øerve Him and required onely from the re≈øt an Oath not to ≈øerve again≈øt Him; And His Maje≈øty ≈øuppo≈øes ≈øuch mo≈øt apt and likely to maintaine their Power by bloud and rapine, who have onely got it by Oppre≈ø≈øion and Inju≈øtice; That His is ve≈øted in Him by the Law, and by that onely (if the de≈øtructive Coun≈øels of Others would not hinder ≈øuch a Peace, in which that might once againe bee the Univer≈øall Rule, and in which Religion and Iu≈øtice can onely flouri≈øh) He de≈øires to maintaine it. And if Peace were equally de≈øired by them, as it is by His Maje≈øty, Hee conceives it would have beene proper to have ≈øent Him ≈øuch a Paper as ≈øhould have contained ju≈øt Propo≈øitions of Peace, and not an unju≈øt Accu≈øation of His Coun≈øels, Proceedings and Per≈øon.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64629:9"/>And His Maje≈øty intends to March to ≈øuch a Di≈øtance from His Citty of <hi>London,</hi> as may take away all Pretence of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øion from his Army, that might hinder them in all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity from yet preparing them to pre≈øent to him, and there will bee ready either to receive them, or to end the pre≈ø≈øures, and mi≈øeries, which His Subjects, to His great Greife, ≈øuffer through this Warre, by a Pre≈øent Battaile.</p>
